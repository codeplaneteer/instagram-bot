 
 We hire a few people to take care of the garden thus creating jobs.
 
 We also teach the school children to garden and we have a garden that
 provides food for the lunch feeding program as well as for some of the members
 of the church.
 
 We tend to the most destitute families.
 
 We provide them with 
 a monthly Family Care Kit which consists of food that will last
 them two to three weeks
